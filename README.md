# SRPG Engine

## About

## Building

This project is made using CMake using C++17 features.

## Testing

Compiling tests requires the Boost testing framework, which is available [here](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).
Actually running unit tests is simple enough, as it dumps an executable in whatever directory you build in.

## Contributing
